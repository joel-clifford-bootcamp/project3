## Description
* This full-stack react application – "Link–N–Park" – essentially allows users to locate bixi bike stations near a particular location, as well as areas to park their bike, and map a route to these locations from their current location
* The application will also allow users to rate these stations and parking areas, and add more detailed comments to expand upon their rating
* This application allows municipalities to supplement their own information with more up-to-date crowd-sourced information.
* This application will also entice users to actively contribute to the service the app offers a tangible benefit to cyclists by streamlining the process of locating parking spaces near their location and destination, and flagging issues with the underlying data; it also provides them with mapped routes.

## Current Features
